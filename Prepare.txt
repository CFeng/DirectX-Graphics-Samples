GPU architecture

ddx,ddy in HLSL
barycenter

hyperbolic Z vs linear Z
	linear: 0 = camera and 1 = far clipping plane
	hyperbolic: 0 = far plane, 1 = near plane

cone tracing vs hiz tracing
cone has bigger step size, can jump multiple mip levels
hiz tracing only jump 1 level at a time

Tiling only affect 2 stages: SSLR_Raytrace and SSLR_Integrate

ResolveRay means get reflection color and depth from previous frame using velocity. Result saved in ResolvedRaysTexture.

LengthTexture stores the shortest ray length includes particle

θ: theta
φ: phi
ξ: xi
Importance Sampling: input: xi, roughness, output: normal of microfacet
xi comes from: Hammersley vs Halton point sets which generates a series of random numbers with a more uniform distribution

PDF: Probability Density Function

BRDF: D - Normal distribution function (specular D); G/V - Geometric shadowing; F: Fresnel

calc refelction vector: Reflect(V, N) = 2(V dot N)N − V
how the confidence of ray tracing is calculated?
clip space (-1, 1), screen space (0, 1), view space

Questions:
Why there is noise in RT?
The rendering equation is a very complicated equation. It is an integral of serveral equations over the hemisphere. There is incoming radiance which might have a really complicated visibility term. BRDF is tricky to sample. In terms of global illumication, the incoming radiance itself is also recersively defined as the outgoing radiance as some other surface point in the scene. Need to have at least hundreds of samples to get some clean image. But in reality we can only have 1-2 samplea per pixel (SPP).

How to denoise:
Accumulation: TAA
Blur: 9 samples from resolved ray buffer, merge with weight. And merge with lower leverl mipmap.
Truncated distribution sampling.


How reflection system works in short.
1. find out which pixels need reflection.
2. shot screen space rays on these pixels.
3. find the hit point color from previous frame, then if DXR partical tracing is not enabled, do screen space particle tracing.
4. if DXR is enabled, and if sslr result has low confidence, shot DXR ray.
5. update the resolved ray buffer with the lit color of ray hit point.
6. do DXR particle ray tracing
7. integrate results: blur, TAA
8. apply the reflection in lighting stage.
