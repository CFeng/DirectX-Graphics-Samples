hyperbolic Z vs linear Z
	linear: 0 = camera and 1 = far clipping plane
	hyperbolic: 0 = far plane, 1 = near plane

calc refelction vector: Reflect(V, N) = 2(V dot N)N âˆ’ V
ddx,ddy in HLSL
how the confidence of ray tracing is calculated?
clip space (-1, 1), screen space (0, 1), view space
barecenter
GPU architecture

Words:
Microfacet
incidence - ru she jiao
specular (mirror), glossy (rough), or diffusive reflection (matte)
artifacts
intersects
interpolated
Perspective-correct
screen coordinate
pseudo
convolution
spherical coordinates

Tricks:
 employs ray length jittering at each iteration step to hide the staircase artifacts.
