hyperbolic Z vs linear Z
	linear: 0 = camera and 1 = far clipping plane
	hyperbolic: 0 = far plane, 1 = near plane

cone tracing vs hiz tracing
cone has bigger step size, can jump multiple hiz levels
hiz tracing only jump 1 level at a time

Tiling only affect 2 stages: SSLR_Raytrace and SSLR_Integrate

ResolveRay means get reflection color and depth from previous frame using velocity. Result saved in ResolvedRaysTexture.

LengthTexture stores the shortest ray length includes particle

θ: theta
ξ: xi
φ: phi
Importance Sampling: input: xi, roughness, output: normal of microfacet
xi comes from: Hammersley vs Halton point sets

PDF: Probability Density Function

BRDF: D - Normal distribution function (specular D); G/V - Geometric shadowing; F: Fresnel

calc refelction vector: Reflect(V, N) = 2(V dot N)N − V
ddx,ddy in HLSL
how the confidence of ray tracing is calculated?
clip space (-1, 1), screen space (0, 1), view space
barecenter
GPU architecture

Words:
Microfacet
incidence - ru she jiao
specular (mirror), glossy (rough), or diffusive reflection (matte)
artifacts
intersects
interpolated
Perspective-correct
screen coordinate
pseudo
convolution
spherical coordinates -- cartesian coordinates
hemisphere
precision
anti aliasing
theoretical
radian -- degree
dielectrics -- conductors

Tricks:
 employs ray length jittering at each iteration step to hide the staircase artifacts.
